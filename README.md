# Casually Competitive Script for TF2

This repo contains my scripts for TF2 and a copy of my autoexec file.

## Installation
To install the scripts, paste each file into the TF2 cfg folder in your Steam installation folder:
%steam install folder%\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg

If you just want to use the script for one class, you must also have a reset.cfg file and a %class%.cfg file
for each class with the line "exec reset.cfg" otherwise the class specific scripts will be bound to all classes.

The [Default](https://github.com/Squidfysh/casually-competitive-script/tree/main/Default) folder contains the
files that must be preset for classes you don't wish to have custom scripts for and a reset.cfg file with the
default TF2 bindings. You can replace the default class files with the ones you would like to use. Be aware
that it may not function properly if only some scripts are used.
