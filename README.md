# Casually Competitive Script for TF2

This repo contains my scripts for TF2 and a copy of my autoexec file.

## Installation
To install the scripts, paste each file into the TF2 cfg folder in your Steam installation folder:
%steam install folder%\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg

If you just want to use the script for one class, you must also have a reset.cfg file and a %class%.cfg file
for each class with the line "exec reset.cfg" otherwise the class specific scripts will be bound to all classes.
